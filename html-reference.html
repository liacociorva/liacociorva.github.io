    <h1>Reference</h1>
    <p>In HTML, tags are crucial in formulating coherent code. The HTML and DOCTYPE tags, (&lt;html&gt;/&lt;/html&gt; and &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;) define the laguage of the document. These are placed at the beginning of the document, and the &lt;/html&gt; tag is placed at the very end. The slash sign is used in a pair of tags to indicate the start and end of the tag.<br> The header tag (&lt;head&gt;) is used to define information about the document that will not be displayed on the actual page. This can inlude titles, styles, and more. It is placed at the top of the page so that it is what the computer reads over first. <br> The title attribute (&lt;title&gt;) is used to title the document and it is what appears in the title of a tab when you open it. This is placed in the header. <br> The body tag (&lt;body&gt;) is what HTML uses to know where the content of the site is actually going to be displayed. This is where content like text, images, and more are placed to appear on the page. It is usually placed somehwere in the middle of the document, but can go anywhere between the &lt;html&gt;/&lt;/html&gt; tags. <br> Headings (&lt;h1&gt;) are form of text that can be organized by number and size. For example, Heading 1 is the largest, Heading 2 is the second largest, so on and so forth. These can go anywhere in the body.<br> Paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;) are the basic text size, usually used for writing the main content of a page (like this). These can also go anywhere in the body. <br> Breaks (&lt;br&gt;) are used when you want to seperate text into lines. This helps create new paragraphs in your text. <br> Lines (&lt;hr&gt;), or horizontal rules, is used to separate content in a web page with a physical line drawn across the page. <hr> Comments (&lt;!-- --&gt;) are used to help the programmer or people reading code, as it is not seen on the page or anywhere else but on the screen of the programmer. It can help organize code or help direct readers. They can be placed anywhere in the page. <br> Links (&lt;a&gt;) are useful and versatile ways to direct users to another web page or another part of your website. These can go anywhere in the body. <br> Images (&lt;img&gt;) are used in many diferent ways. They can provide information in a website, or they can simply help decorate and assist with the style of the page. These can also go anywhere in the body. <br> Lists (&lt;ul&gt;,&lt;ol&gt;,&lt;li&gt;) are used to organize information or text in the form of bullets, stars, cirles, squares, dashes, and more. These can also go anywhere in the body.<br> Tables are another way to organize information. Tables (&lt;table&gt;,&lt;tr&gt;,&lt;th&gt;,&lt;td&gt;) are usually used as a way to separate numbers and data in a way that is easily understandable and readable. These can, again, go anywhere in the body.<br> Blocks (&lt;div&gt;) are, again, a way to oranize content. They are often used to seperate information, either to target a certain block of code for style, or for many other purposes. <br> Overall, tags are a key feature of what makes HTML itself.</p>
